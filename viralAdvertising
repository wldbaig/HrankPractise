/*HackerLand Enterprise is adopting a new viral advertising strategy. When they launch a new product, they advertise it to exactly 5 people on social media.

On the first day, half of those 5 people (i.e., 5/2 = 2 ) like the advertisement and each shares it with 3 of their friends. At the beginning of the second day, 5/2=2*3=6 people receive the advertisement.

Each day, floor(receipients/2) of the recipients like the advertisement and will share it with 3 friends on the following day. 
Assuming nobody receives the advertisement twice, determine how many people have liked the ad by the end of a given day, beginning with launch day as day .

Example*/

class Solution {
    static void Main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution */
        var numberOfDays = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
        
        var advertCount = 5;
        var totalCount = 0;
        
        for(int i=0; i < numberOfDays; i++)
            {
            totalCount = totalCount + advertCount/2;
            advertCount =advertCount/2 * 3;
        }
        Console.WriteLine(totalCount);
